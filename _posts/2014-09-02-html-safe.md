As we all know, in Rails all strings will be escaped
`<%= dangerous_string %>             <!-- Safe -->`

But if we use html_safe which is telling template turn off escape.
`<%= dangerous_string.html_safe %>   <!-- Unsafe! -->`
btw, `raw`, `==` is the same as `html_safe`

#### What will it be after call `html_safe` on a string?
``` ruby
"string".html_safe.class
# => ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer
```
calling `html_safe` is no different other than returning a SafeBuffer object.

You could see [active_support/core_ext/string/output_safety.rb](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7ce68406934c50a2ce3079bea4fd34936388c26a/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/string/output_safety.rb)

There're many methods can turn safe buffer to unsafe. like
``` ruby
capitalize chomp chop delete downcase gsub lstrip next reverse rstrip
slice squeeze strip sub succ swapcase tr tr_s upcase prepend
```

#### Why do they change?
``` ruby
UNSAFE_STRING_METHODS.each do |unsafe_method|
  if unsafe_method.respond_to?(unsafe_method)
    class_eval <<-EOT, __FILE__, __LINE__ + 1
      def #{unsafe_method}(*args, &block)       # def capitalize(*args, &block)
        to_str.#{unsafe_method}(*args, &block)  #   to_str.capitalize(*args, &block)
      end                                       # end

      def #{unsafe_method}!(*args)              # def capitalize!(*args)
        @html_safe = false                      #   @html_safe = false
        super                                   #   super
      end                                       # end
    EOT
  end
end
```
**Which means if you need to call these methods on a SafeBuffer object, you must take care, they aint a SafeBuffer any more.**

One more thing, `sanitize` is a whitelist filter method which will html encode all tags and strip all attributes that aren't specifically allowed. If you're John Snow(know nothing), use this method. see http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html
