I'm not a good English speaker, but I'm trying to express my thoughts correctly here.

I'm working in a kind of a big company, there're almost at least 500 people in China, besides, there're a lot more in Dallas TX. During the work days, many things happen. Here's what I learnt:

### Try not to compromise
You wanted to do some correct things, there maybe blockers there. Like, you don't know who to find to resolve this problem or you feel shy to ask for something. In big company, there's a bunch of resources there, people, products, tools, services. Don't be shy to use them. If you feel embarrassed and not to use them, that's your fault, you could have worked this out. Just ask for help from others, push things forward!

### Burst correct-crap balloons
Inevitablely, many people have many nonsense words(correct crap) which distracts things from right track, confuse/mislead the people. When such things happen, I'm gonna burst those nonsense balloons, tell the make-sense words, which I think could help people make correct decisions and highly improve productivity. None the less, there're people knowing that someone is giving nonsense words(correct crap), however, they just let that happen, maybe bureaucratic? or? As for me, I cannot let wrong things happen.

### Take more responsibilities
As a programmer, I do more work, focus more on project, try to improve our code/project. Get more knowledge about project and related information, so you can use them in case some other guys need help.

OK, that's it, thank you!
